<h3>Overview</h3>
👨‍💻 In this project, We try to record our voice and turn it to Image by using OpenAI Whisper,GPT-4 Vision, Dall-E 3 models and Gemini Pro Vision. Also, Image and Recorded Voice can be used as multimodal sample. In the project, streamlit library has been used as UI and python multithreading concept has been applied.
