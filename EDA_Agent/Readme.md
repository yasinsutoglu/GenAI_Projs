<h1 align="center">Explatory Data Analysis Agent</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
üë®‚Äçüíª In this project, We try to create EDA Agent application by using 3 optional models from OpenAI and Anthropic. After choosing your LLM  and uploading your CSV document, the app gives the EDA information about your dataset and then you can examine the interaction with the EDA Agent about your dataset. In other words, Basic Autonomuous Data Analyst was created in here but this project is open to customize your needs. As in other projects, streamlit library has been used for UI concept in this project.
